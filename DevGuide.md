**This dev guide is generated by chatGPT.**

1. **Environment Setup:**

   - Create a virtual environment for your project to keep dependencies isolated.
   - Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **UI Implementation (`ui/app.py`):**

   - Import necessary modules and libraries.
   - Create a basic Tkinter application window.
   - Add input fields for email credentials and buttons for actions.
   - Implement button click handlers to trigger email retrieval and display notifications.
3. **Email Retrieval (`email_utils/email_fetcher.py`):**

   - ~~Import `imaplib` and other necessary modules.~~
   - `IMAPClient` works with non-standard IMAP servers in China.
   - Implement a function to connect to the email server and fetch emails.
   - Parse email content (subject, sender, body) from fetched emails.
   - Looking at [`email.message`](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/email.message.html#module-email.message "email.message: The base class representing email messages.") .
4. **OpenAI's ChatGPT Integration (`email_utils/email_summarizer.py` and `email_utils/openai_api.py`):**

   - Create an account on the OpenAI platform and obtain API credentials.
   - Implement a function to interact with the OpenAI API and generate summaries.
5. **Email Classification (`email_utils/email_classifier.py`):**

   - Implement basic keyword-based classification logic.
   - Classify emails into categories such as "Important," "Promotions," "Personal," etc.
6. **Storage (`storage/emails.json`):**

   - Implement functions to read and write email data to the JSON file.
   - Store email subject, sender, body, summary, and category in the JSON format.
7. **Notification Generation (`ui/app.py`):**

   - Implement functions to generate notifications using `plyer` or similar libraries.
   - Show pop-up notifications for new emails and summaries.
8. **Putting It All Together (`main.py`):**

   - Import necessary modules from the `ui` and `email_utils` packages.
   - Set up the main application loop.
   - Implement the logic to fetch emails, generate summaries, classify, and display notifications.
9. **Testing and Debugging:**

   - Test each component of the application independently.
   - Debug any errors and refine your code.
10. **Documentation and Refinement:**

    - Write clear comments and documentation for your code.
    - Refactor and optimize your code for better readability and performance.
11. **Demo and Presentation:**

    - Prepare a demonstration of your application's features.
    - Present your project's functionality, code structure, and design choices.
